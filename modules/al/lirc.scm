;;; Commentary:

;; This file provides some code that can be used to make a custom LIRC
;; client (written in Guile!) instead of the default 'irexec'
;; facilities.
;;
;; So instead of writing a dumb (non-programmable) "~/.lircrc"
;; configuration file, I simply use this module (in my Guile-Daemon
;; config) to connect to the lircd socket and to handle the keys I press
;; on my remote control.
