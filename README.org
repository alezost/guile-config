** About

This repository contains my [[http://www.gnu.org/software/guile][Guile]] modules and scripts (thus it has
nothing to do with a great Alex Sassmannshausen's [[https://github.com/a-sassmannshausen/guile-config][guile-config]] library).

=guile-config= is probably not the best name for this repository, but I
couldn't invent a better one, and since I already have such things as
[[https://github.com/alezost/emacs-config][emacs-config]], [[https://github.com/alezost/stumpwm-config][stumpwm-config]], [[https://github.com/alezost/shepherd-config][shepherd-config]], etc., I decided to use
this name.
